# riddle_bot

## Objective
To create a Python script that uses Reddit's API.

## Steps Taken
I first watched a video series by the YouTuber [busterroni11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krTUf7BpTc0 "How to make a Reddit Bot") to familiarize myself with the Python modules Beautiful Soup and PRAW. Beautiful Soup is used to scrape a riddle from the website [Good Riddles Now](http://goodriddlesnow.com/riddles/random). When a Reddit user mentions the user I created (u/riddle_bot), PRAW is used to reply to the comment with a random riddle. When users ask for the answer to the riddle, PRAW is used to send the user the answer.

## Result
With the Python modules Beautiful Soup and Praw, I was able to create a script that interacts with Reddit users. The project was fun because I learned so much while creating a silly bot.
